    "\n",
    "In this lab assessment, you'll practice your knowledge of JOIN statements and subqueries, using various types of joins and various methods for specifying the links between them. One of the main benefits of using a relational database is the table relations that define them which allow you to access and connect data together via shared columns. By writing more advanced SQL queries that utilize joins and subqueries you can provide a deeper and more granular level of analysis and data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assessment will continue looking at the familiar Northwind database that contains customer relationship management (CRM) data as well as employee and product data. You will take a deeper dive into this database in order to accomplish more advanced SQL queries that require you to access data from multiple tables at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are working in an analyst role for the sales rep team. They have collaborated with the customer relations and the product teams to take a comprehensive look at the employee to customer pipeline in an attempt to find areas of improvement and potential growth. You have been asked to provide some specific data and statistics regarding this project."
